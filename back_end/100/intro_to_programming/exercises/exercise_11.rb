# https://ruby-doc.org/ One of the first things it asks you is, "New to Ruby?" It contains links to topics covered the the prep course. There's also a section dedicated to "Getting Started", which contains a book of Programming Ruby, more downloads, an article to help you build your first application, etc. 
# There are more books listed on another section and also cool stuff like shirts and mugs.
