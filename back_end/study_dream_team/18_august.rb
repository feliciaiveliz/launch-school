# ampersand will convert something from what it is to the opposite( block -> proc or proc-> bloc)
# (&:symbol)
# This is an example of Rubyâ€™s syntactical sugar. Under the hood, Ruby checks whether the symbol object after `&` is a `Proc`. If it is it uses the object as-is. Otherwise it calls `#to_proc` on the object which should return a `Proc` object. An error will occur if it fails to convert. 
# `&` then turns the Proc into a block.

Crypto Square
Implement the classic method for composing secret messages called a square code.

The input is first normalized: The spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the message is down-cased.

Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows. These rows can be regarded as forming a rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.

For example, the sentence

If man was meant to stay on the ground god would have given us roots

is 54 characters long.

Broken into 8-character columns, it yields 7 rows.

Those 7 rows produce this rectangle when printed one per line:

ifmanwas
meanttos
tayonthe
groundgo
dwouldha
vegivenu
sroots
The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right. For example, the message above is coded as:

imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn sseoau
Write a program that, given an English text, outputs the encoded version of that text.

The size of the square (number of columns) should be decided by the length of the message. If the message is a length that creates a perfect square (e.g. 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, etc), use that number of columns. If the message doesn't fit neatly into a square, choose the number of columns that corresponds to the smallest square that is larger than the number of characters in the message.

For example, a message 4 characters long should use a 2 x 2 square. A message that is 81 characters long would use a square that is 9 columns wide. A message between 5 and 8 characters long should use a rectangle 3 characters wide.

Output the encoded text grouped by column.

Test suite:

# goal is to encrypt

# my_obj = Proc.new { puts "hi"} # instantiated a new `Proc` object.
# my_str = 'Hello'
# my_lambda = lambda{ |n| return 'my lambda'}
# # p my_obj
# # p my_lambda

# def a_method(obj)
#   [1,2,3].map(&obj) 
# end

# p a_method(my_obj)
# p a_method(my_lambda)
# a_method(my_str)


# new_proc = proc { p "I'm singing in the rain!"}
# def sing(&new_proc)
#   p new_proc
#   new_proc.call
# end
  
# sing { p "I'm singing in the rain!"}
# def method_with_explicit_block(&block)
#  puts "1"
#  another_method(block)
# end

# method_with_explicit_block { puts "3" }


# def method_with_proc(new_proc)
#  new_proc.call
# end

# name = "Chris"
# new_proc = proc { name }

# p method_with_proc(new_proc)

Richard - look at the question first, understand the problem first, look at what i don't understand.
# there are some lines that i may not understand and i spend time digesting.
Then i look at the test cases - they tell me what i need to understand - i write notes next to the test cases.
I write down my algorithm and type that out. Then i play around with my test cases as i go along.
Felicia - start by getting a whole picture of what they are asking
- jump into test cases at one time
- Look at what type of methods they ask for
