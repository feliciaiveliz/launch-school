numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3]
numbers.uniq

puts numbers

I expect this code to print out: 

1
2
2
3

Array#uniq returns a new array with the duplicate elements removed. In this problem, the #uniq method doesn't end with a !, therefore it is non-destructive. 
Kernel#puts prints out the string value of each element on its own line, as opposed to printing it in its array form.
