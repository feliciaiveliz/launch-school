### Sometimes, the documentation is going to leave you scratching your head. In a very early assignment at Launch School, you are tasked with writing a program that loads some text messages from a YAML file. We do this with YAML::load_file:

```require 'yaml'
MESSAGES = YAML.load_file('calculator_messages.yml')
```
