# Find the Class

# Update the following code so that, instead of printing the values, each statement prints the name of the class to which it belongs.

puts "Hello".class
puts 5.class
puts [1, 2, 3].class

# All values are objects. Each object is an instance of a class.
# Use `class` to find the class to which the object belongs to.
