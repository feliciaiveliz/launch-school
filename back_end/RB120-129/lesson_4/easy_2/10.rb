# One benefit is grouping together similar methods or classes that could share possible behavior. 
# Instead of writing repetitve code with could write one method and have that method be shared to multiple classes without having to write it over and over.
# You have control over how methods can be used by other people.

# Creating objects allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
# Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.
# It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
# It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication.
# We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
# As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more easily managed.
