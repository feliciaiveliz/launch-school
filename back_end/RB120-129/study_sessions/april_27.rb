# If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.


# "a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

# Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" (as a string)

# Create a function that will return a string that combines all of the letters of the three inputed strings in groups. Taking the first letter of all of the inputs and grouping them next to each other. Do this for every letter, see example below!

# E.g. Input: "aa", "bb" , "cc" => Output: "abcabc"

# Note: You can expect all of the inputs to be the same length.

# You've just discovered a square (NxN) field and you notice a warning sign. The sign states that there's a single bomb in the 2D grid-like field in front of you.

# Write a function mineLocation/MineLocation that accepts a 2D array, and returns the location of the mine. The mine is represented as the integer 1 in the 2D array. Areas in the 2D array that are not the mine will be represented as 0s.

# The location returned should be an array where the first element is the row index, and the second element is the column index of the bomb location (both should be 0 based). All 2D arrays passed into your function will be square (NxN), and there will only be one mine in the array.
