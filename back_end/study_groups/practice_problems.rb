Have the method letter_changes(str) take the str parameter being passed and
modify it using the following algorithm. Replace every letter in the string
with the 3rd letter following it in the alphabet (ie. c becomes f, Z becomes C).
Then return this modified string.
=end

p letter_changes("this long cake@&") == "wklv orqj fdnh@&"
p letter_changes("Road trip9") == "Urdg wuls9"
p letter_changes("EMAILZ@gmail.com") == "HPDLOC@jpdlo.frp"
p letter_changes('xyz') == ('abc')

=begin
Write a method that takes in a number and returns a string, placing
a dash in between odd digits.
=end

p dasherizer(2112) == '21-12'
p dasherizer(201105742) == '201-105-742'
p dasherizer(123456789) == '123456789'
p dasherizer(21121) == '21-121'

=begin
Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.
Each letter of a word scores points according to it's position in the alphabet:
a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.
You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.
If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.
All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.
=end

p alphabet_score('man i need a taxi up to ubud') == 'taxi'
p alphabet_score('what time are we climbing up the volcano') == 'volcano'
p alphabet_score('take me to semynak') == 'semynak'
p alphabet_score('aa b') == 'aa'
