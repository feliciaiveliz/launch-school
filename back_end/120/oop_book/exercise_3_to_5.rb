# 3. Create a class called MyCar. When you initialize a new instance or object of the class, allow the user to define some instance variables that tell us the year, color, and model of the car. Create an instance variable that is set to 0 during instantiation of the object to track the current speed of the car as well. Create instance methods that allow 

# class MyCar
#   attr_accessor :year, :color, :model, :current_speed

#   def initialize(year, color, model, current_speed)
#     @year = year
#     @color = color
#     @model = model
#     @current_speed = current_speed
#   end

#   def speed_up
#     current_speed + 30
#   end

#   def brake
#     current_speed - current_speed
#   end

#   def shut_off
#     current_speed - current_speed

#   def change_speeds(current_speed)
#     @current_speed = current_speed
