- I learned that classes are basically molds that objects are created from. 
- Multiple objects can be created from the same class but each object will have different attributes
- An object will have a state or states and behaviors
- Instance variables track an objects state
- Instance methods expose an objects behavior or information
- Modules are collections of code behavior that can be used by classes via mixins
- Classes use the keyword 'include' to use a Modules behaviors
