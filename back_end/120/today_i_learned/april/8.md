### What did I learn today?

I worked through the 3rd and 4th chapters of the OOP book, called Classes and Objects Part 2 and Inheritance.

I learned:

- To expose information of a state of an object, use `attr_reader`
- To change information of a state of an object, use `attr_writer`
- To create getter and setter methods for an object, use `attr_accessor`. This also create instance variables
- Instance variables start with one `@` symbol
- Class variables start with two `@@` symbols
- A super class is a class where another class inherits from
- A subclass is a class that inherits from another class
- Ruby uses method lookup path to find methods and invoke them. It starts with the object class and moves on from there
- It's best to use modules and mixins to prevent code that is not DRY
