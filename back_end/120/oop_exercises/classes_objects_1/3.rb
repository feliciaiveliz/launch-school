# Create the Object

# Using the code from the previous exercise, create an instance of Cat and assign it to a variable named kitty.

class Cat
end

kitty = Cat.new

# To instantiate a new `Cat` object, we use the class method ::new. This method returns a new instance of the class it was invoked upon.
# We now have a cat object. To use it, we need to assign it to a variable. This variable can be used to interact with the object in various ways.
