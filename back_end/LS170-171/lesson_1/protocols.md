# Protocols

- we use protocols to make sure that different devices connected to different networks are able to communicate
- **protocols** are a system of rules that govern the exchange or transmission of data

### What are some examples of protocols?

- IP
- SMTP
- TCP
- HTTP
- Enternet
- FTP
- DNS
- UDP
- TLS

### Why are there so many types of protocols?

- different protocols were created to address *different* aspects of network communication
- different protocols were created to address the *same* aspect of network communication, but in a different way or for a specific use case

### Protocols for Different Aspects of Communication

- to make sure that a message is understood by another device, words or data must be in a certain order
- in human conversation, we can think of this as word order
- this word order is part of the **syntactical rules** that govern the *structure* of the message
- besides the order of the words themselves, we need to structure the words and *messages in order too*
- this can be considered the *flow and order* of the messages in the conversation
- this message order is part of the **message transfer rules** how how we speak
