# The Internet

### What is a Network?

- two devices that are connected in a way that they can communicate or exchange data
- the most basic way is to connect two computers together using a LAN cable

### What is LAN (Local Area Network)?

- more commonly, a network is multiple computers and other devices connected together by a network bridging device, which could be a hub or switch
- at home, most likely computers are connected through a wireless hub; this is known as WLAN
- this imposes limitations because only the devices that are connected (whether wirelessly or not) are able to communicate with each other

### What is Inter-network Communication?

- to enable communication between networks, we need to use *routers*
- *routers* are network devices that can route network traffic to other networks

### Network of Networks

- we can imagine then that the internet is a network of networks connected together
- in the sub-networks, the systems of routers are directing the network traffic
