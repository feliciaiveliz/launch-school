On `line 1` we initialize local variable `a` in the outer scope and set it to reference a String object with a value of `hello`.

On `line 1` we initialize local variable `a` and set it to reference an Integer object with a value of `5`.

On `line 1` we initialize local variable `arr` and set it to reference an Array object that contains `4` Integer objects with values of `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`.

On `lines 1-3` we invoke the `loop` method invocation and pass in the `do..end` block to it as an argument. This defines a block and creates an inner scope.

On `lines 1-3` the `do..end` following the `loop` method invocation defines a block and therefore creates an inner scope.

On `line 1` we invoke the `puts` method and pass in local variable `a` to it as an argument, outputting its value, which is `7`.

This code example outputs integers `1-4` and returns `nil`.

The `each` method outputs `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, and returns the original calling object, the Array object `arr` is referencing. 

On `line 1` we initialize local variable `counter` and set it to reference an Integer object with a value of `0`. This variable is used to keep track of the number of iterations performed by the `loop` method invocation.

On `line 1` we use the keyword `break` along with an `if` conditional statement. 

On `line 1` we increment the `counter` by `1`.

On `line 5` we are reassigning the local variable `counter` to the return value of a method call `Integer#+` on a local variable `counter` with integer `1` passed to it as an argument.

The keyword `break` and the condition `if` statement on `line 5` will execute when the integer represented by the `counter` variable is equal to the size of the `numbers` array.

The `do..end` following the `each` method invocation defines a block and is passed to `each` as an argument to the method.

Local variable `a` is being initialized to a String object with a value of `hello`.

Local variable `b` is being initialized to the same String object that local variable `a` is referencing.
