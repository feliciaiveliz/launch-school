=begin

Write a method that takes a string with one or more space separated words and returns a hash that shows the number of words of different sizes.

Words consist of any string of characters that do not include a space.

input: string
output: hash
rules: 
- words are string of chars that don't include spaces
- string can contain one or more spaces consecutively
- hash will contain keys that are integers
  - keys == string size
  - values == number of strings of that size
data structure: array, string, hash
pseudo-code: 
- split string into individual strings
- create an empty hash that will contain integers for keys and values
- tally number of words and their sizes
-
