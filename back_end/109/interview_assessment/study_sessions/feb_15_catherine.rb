Have the method letter_changes(str) take the str parameter being passed and
modify it using the following algorithm. Replace every letter in the string
with the 3rd letter following it in the alphabet (ie. c becomes f, Z becomes C).
Then return this modified string.

input: string
output: new string
rules:
- replace letter with 3rd letter following it in alphabet
- ignore anything that's not a letter, add it to string as is
- if letter is capital letter, add 3rd letter following it as capital
data structures: string, array
problem: 
- What do i want to do with the input?
  - map letters in alphabet with their positions
  - iterate over the string and replace each letter with it's 3rd follow. letter
  - add punct/digits to str as it is, then move on to the next char
  - if we add 3 to current letter index, and it 's greater than or equal to array size, 
    start over from beginning of alphabet
algorithm:
- create an array of upper letters
- create array of lower letters
- create an empty array to add letters to
- split the string into an array of chars
- iterate: 
  - if the char is included in the lower array
    - assign to index the index of the letter i need (3rd)
    - add it's 3rd following letter to the new array
  - if the char is included in the upper array
    - add it's 3rd following letter to the new array
  - if it's not included in either array
    - add char into the array
  - if the index of the 3rd char is >= array
