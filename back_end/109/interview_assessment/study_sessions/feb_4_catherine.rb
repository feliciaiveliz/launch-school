=begin

For "x", determine how many positive integers less than or equal to "x" are odd but not prime. Assume "x" is an integer between 1 and 10000.

Example: 5 has three odd numbers (1,3,5) and only the number 1 is not prime, so the answer is 1
Example: 10 has five odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9) and only 1 and 9 are not prime, so the answer is 2

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

=begin
input: integer between 1 and 10,000
output: integer; numbers that are odd and not prime
data structure: array, integer
algorithm: 
- create prime? method
  - from 1 up to 'n', if number is evenly divisible by the integer passed to block
    - is it NOT prime 
  - true otherwise
- create an empty array
- if number is not prime, (return false) and it's odd
  - push to array
  - if number is 1, push to array
- count the number of digits in array

    num if num.odd? && not_prime?(num)
