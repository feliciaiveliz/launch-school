Have the method letter_changes(str) take the str parameter being passed and
modify it using the following algorithm. Replace every letter in the string
with the 3rd letter following it in the alphabet (ie. c becomes f, Z becomes C).
Then return this modified string.

Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.
Each letter of a word scores points according to it's position in the alphabet:
a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.
You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.
If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.
All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.
=end

p alphabet_score('man i need a taxi up to ubud') == 'taxi'
p alphabet_score('what time are we climbing up the volcano') == 'volcano'
p alphabet_score('take me to semynak') == 'semynak'
p alphabet_score('aa b') == 'aa'

# You've just discovered a square (NxN) field and you notice a warning sign. The sign states that there's a single bomb in the 2D grid-like field in front of you.

# Write a function mineLocation/MineLocation that accepts a 2D array, and returns the location of the mine. The mine is represented as the integer 1 in the 2D array. Areas in the 2D array that are not the mine will be represented as 0s.

All 2D arrays passed into your function will be square (NxN), and there will only be one mine in the array.

problem:
- each word contains a single digit
- the string should start with the word that contains number 1
- split string into seperate words and sort by:
  - search for the number contained in the word and use that to sort
- return the sorted string
algorithm:
- split string and sort using #split and #sort_by, for each 'word':
  - use #scan to find the digit and this is what will be used by #sort_by to sort the string
- return new string of sorted words
