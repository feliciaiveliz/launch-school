// Implement a function that takes some text as an argument and logs some information about whether the text has a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

/*
input: string of text
output: summary of sentiment of text, in the form of strings
rules:
- text is positive if difference is positive (positive - negative)
- text is negative if difference is negative
- text is neutral if difference is 0
algorithm:
- declare variable 'positiveStrings' to []
- declare variable 'negativeStrings' to []
- declare variable 'result' to 0
- call filter() on input string:
  - cb function: add word to positiveStrings if positiveWords contains word
    - repeat operation with negative words
- Count the number of words in each array using 'length'
- 'result' = positiveStrings - negativeStrings
- return summary
